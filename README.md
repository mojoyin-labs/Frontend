# Frontend (Reset — The Basics)

A simple static webpage built to practice HTML + CSS fundamentals and Git workflow.

## Preview
Open `index.html` in a browser (or use VS Code Live Server).

## Features
- Navigation bar
- Goal section with strengths list
- Profile card with image and CTA button

## Tech Stack Learning
- HTML
  Which was learning of structuring the webpage:
  From the <head> tag to the <span> tag. 
- CSS (Flexbox)
  From styling the navbar with background colors to creating a mini-business card
- Local font via `@font-face`:
  After learning google font(which is commented). I learnt local font.
  Rule of thumb: Use only 2 or 3 fonts to ensure perfomance when using `@font-face`;
